In this analysis, I used the California Housing dataset from sklearn.

I explored the relationship between the average number of rooms (AveRooms)
and the median house value (MedHouseVal).

The correlation scatter plot shows a positive relationship.
As the average number of rooms increases, the median house value generally increases.

However, the data points are spread out, which indicates that the correlation
is not perfectly linear and that other factors may also affect house prices.
